Recursion in computer science is a technique where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem


"It mainly works on principle called "CALL STACK"."
Example1 : Factorial!
N = 5 
f(N) = N!
    = N * (N-1)
    = N * f(N - 1) 

Example2 : Go to Home :

Base Case:
1. If you are at home, stop moving.

Recursive case:
2. Take one step toward home.
3. "Go to Home"

Recursion = Principal of Mathematical Induction

1. Figure out the Smallest case
2. Always assume the subproblem can be solved.
3. Solve the current probelm  assuming subproblem solution is exists.
